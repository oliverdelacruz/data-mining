# ETH Course - Data Mining

Many scientific and commercial applications require us to obtain insights from massive, high-dimensional data sets. In this graduate-level course, students will learn to apply, analyze and evaluate principled, state-of-the-art techniques from statistics, algorithms and discrete and convex optimization for learning from such large data sets.

## Description

This repository gathers all the assigments done during the exercise sessions.
